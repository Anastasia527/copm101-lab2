My name is Anastasia Piciriga. I am 19 years old, and I have lived in Canada for 15 years.
I am originally from a small country in Europe, Moldova, which is right next to Ukraine. I moved here when I was 2, lived here for a year, moved back to Moldova when I was 3, and then moved back when I was 5 years old. So, I officially started living here when I was 5.
I know six languages, and I love to travel and see the beauty of the world. I live with my family and two pets—Mira (my dog) and Bella (my cat).
I've always been interested in design and drawing, and I've always thought of myself as creative.



Question: 
You have created a GitHub repository and want to share it with your friend Bob by 
sending him the repository link. When Bob clicks the link in his web browser, some 
communication happens over the internet. Explain step by step what happens using the 
concepts of client and server. In your explanation, make sure to mention:
• Which device acts as the client: Bob's device (computer/phone).
• Which device acts as the server: GitHub's remote servers.
• How Bob’s browser requests the repository content: Bob’s browser sends an HTTP GET request over the internet to GitHub’s server after resolving the GitHub URL to an IP address using DNS.
• How the server responds and sends the content back to Bob: GitHub’s server processes the request, then sends back an HTTP response containing the web page’s content (like HTML, CSS, and repository data), which the browser displays to Bob.

Post-Lab Questions
1. What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?
HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the standard protocol for transferring data on the web, but it is not secure.
HTTPS (HTTP Secure) does the same job but adds encryption using SSL/TLS, making the data exchange secure and private. HTTPS protects against eavesdropping and tampering.
2. Explain how DNS and IP work together to enable communication over the Internet.
DNS (Domain Name System) translates human-readable domain names (like github.com) into IP addresses (like 140.82.114.3).
The IP address tells computers where to find the server hosting the website, allowing devices to communicate over the Internet.
3. What is a URL? What are the different parts of a URL?
A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the full web address used to access resources online.
Parts of a URL:
Protocol: https://
Domain name: www.example.com
Path: /folder/page.html
(Optional) Query string: ?id=123
(Optional) Fragment: #section2
Example:
https://www.example.com/folder/page.html?id=123#section2
4. How are URLs used on the Internet?
URLs are used to locate and access resources (like web pages, images, files) on the Internet. When you enter a URL in a browser, it sends a request to the server hosting that resource, and the server responds with the content.
5. How can you recognize whether something is a pathname or a URL? (I.e., what is visibly different 
about them?)
A URL includes a protocol (like http:// or https://) and a domain name (like example.com).
A pathname is just a local file path and does not include a domain or protocol.
URL example: https://example.com/images/photo.jpg
Pathname example: /images/photo.jpg or C:\Users\Bob\Documents\file.txt

My name is Anastasia Piciriga. I am 19 years old, and I have lived in Canada for 15 years.
I am originally from a small country in Europe, Moldova, which is right next to Ukraine. I moved here when I was 2, lived here for a year, moved back to Moldova when I was 3, and then moved back when I was 5 years old. So, I officially started living here when I was 5.
I know six languages, and I love to travel and see the beauty of the world. I live with my family and two petsâ€”Mira (my dog) and Bella (my cat).
I've always been interested in design and drawing, and I've always thought of myself as creative.
